2. How does any web browser understand how to open any webpage?
   A web browser takes a request object and sends out the appropriate response.

3. Name one thing a request object must have, and one thing a response object must have
   Requests need to have a method to know what kind of action to perform and some kind of url to know which endpoint to access.
   Responses need to have some kind of body that contains the appropriate data and a status code determining whether the action was successful.

4. What is the difference between HTTP and REST?
   HTTP is a set of rules and REST is a bunch of guidelines that can be followed or ignored.
