# Class 22 Reading

1. Describe a case where snapshot testing would be useful, and describe another case where it would be ineffective.

   Snapshots are useful in cases where you only need to refactor. If the UI has to constantly be changed, snapshots quickly become out of date and aren't effective.

2. What is the difference between full mount and shallow mount?

   Full mount seems to mount the entire component along with all children components. Shallow mount mounts the currently component only.

3. What does npm run build do?

   It seems to build the website for deployment by creating an index.html along with JavaScript and compiled CSS files.
