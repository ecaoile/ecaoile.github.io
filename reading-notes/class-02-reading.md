1. What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?

   One benefit is that code can be syntactically simple. You don't have to account for different variable types in situations where you might want you variable to have multiple possible types.

2. What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?

   The upside can also be seen as a downside. Because JavaScript is so flexible, it can result in errors from passing in an improper data type.

3. Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?

   If you want to adhere to functional programming, you're not supposed to modify external variables. If you want to change a variable, you can probably do a direct variable assignment outside of the function using the return value of the function as opposed to modifying the parameter itself.

4. Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?

   Boolean is a simple variable type that can be `true` or `false`. In JavaScript, you can evaluate a boolean in an if statement for being true or false respectively by doing something like `if (hasGreenEggs)` or `if (!likesGreenEggs)`.
