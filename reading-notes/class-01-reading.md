1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
   Sometimes you want to do things with code other than build a page to display as a browser, and JavaScript and can do that now. Hooray!

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?

- module: pieces of JavaScript code called in another file or chunk of code
- package: allows developers to make complex code, publish it, and share packages for other developers

Packages are more complicated and are shared to other developers from outside the repo (using npm). Modules are smaller in scale and exist within the repo originally.

3. What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?
   Test driven development allows developers to verify that their code does what they think it does.

4. What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?
   It takes up time. I know this because I've done it before.

5. What does the node package manager do?
   It allows users to download packages onto their repo to use.
