# Class 10 Reading

1.  Why is authentication important?

    Authentication verifies that we are who we say we are.

2.  Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?

    If the database gets hacked, someone has access to it.

3.  What is the difference between hashing and encryption?

    Hashing means that the data is encoded in a way that's difficult to decode. A probably designed hashing algorithm should make it impossible to reverse the hash. Encryption, however, can be decrypted with a key.

4.  What is the difference between encryption and encoding?

    Encoding refactors data for data usabliity and encryption scrambles data for data confidentiality.

5.  What is a token used for?

    A token is a validation response from the server so that the client can re-authenticate without sending a username and password.
