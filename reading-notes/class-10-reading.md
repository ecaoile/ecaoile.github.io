# Class 10 Reading

1. Why is authentication important?

   Authentication verifies that we are who we say we are.

2. Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?

   If the database gets hacked, someone has access to it.

3. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?

   Hashing means that the data is encoded in a way that's difficult to decode. A probably designed hashing algorithm should make it impossible to reverse the hash. Encryption, however, can be decrypted with a key.

4. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?

   Encoding refactors data for data usabliity and encryption scrambles data for data confidentiality.

5. What is a token used for?

   A token is a validation response from the server so that the client can re-authenticate without sending a username and password.
