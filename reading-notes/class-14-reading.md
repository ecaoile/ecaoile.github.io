# Class 14 Reading

1. Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.

   I think the better question is "why isn't it important?" Do we want everyone to have access to dirty secrets? Should every user on Amazon be able to see every other user's payment info and shopping history? That would be weird.

2. What is a role used for?

   A role defines what a certain kind of user can and can't do.

3. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

   It's possible to assign the same role to multiple users. With the other methods, you may have to constantly re-assign privileges. That's annoying. Discretionary access works for Google Docs because it's usually done on a smaller scale. Try managing 10,000 users on Google Docs. I bet that's a pain.
