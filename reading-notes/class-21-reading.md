1.  What is the benefit of breaking up HTML webpage content into components?

    Breaking up an HTML webpage into components allows for modularity. It provides the same benefits of general modularity: less merge conflicts, the ability to work on one part of the app directly, and the ability to import/export.

2.  What is JSX? Why is it useful?

    JSX means JavaScript XML. It allows JavaScript and HTML to be mixed into one file.

3.  What can cause a render (or re-render) of a component?

    A change in state causes a render or re-render.

4.  When a render happens, how is the DOM affected

    The DOM changes because a render/re-render builds and displays the HTML elements.

5.  What is one thing a framework does that a library doesnâ€™t do?

    A frame work can control when certain pieces of code are called.
