1. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

    This allows React to treat the function differently and return a stateful variable.

2. What do custom hooks usually do?

    It does stuff that wasn't previously possible in React components before. You can do cool stuff like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, and timers.

3. Using the links above, list one custom hook that you would be interested in trying/using.

    I see a useReducer custom hook that might have simplified the lab we just did. We'll probably end up doing that...
