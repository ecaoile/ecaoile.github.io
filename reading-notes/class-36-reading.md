# Class 36 Reading

I decided to look into React because I heard it used to be the bee's knees but then got shunned.

Angular is a framework for building web apps, and React being is a library for building UI components. Also, Angular is built on TypeScript, whereas React works with regular JavaScript. This point is not necessarily 100% true because the project I work with right now currently runs on React with Typescript.

More of the differences are listed here: https://www.guru99.com/react-vs-angular-key-difference.html

To try to summarize, Angular is a more complete solution and generally requires more time to learn. There is less flexibility because it is more of a complete solution. It's hard to say which one is better for sure because they seem to serve different purposes.
